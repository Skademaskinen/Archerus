# Archerus
This repository contains configuration for the server "Skademaskinen", and system-manager configuration for my personal computers.

The name "Skademaskinen" for the organisation stems from my character in World of Warcraft; Skademanden. It's a death knight, and for the longest time i've thought about how i wanted to name this repository. Essentially its a typo of a place in the game that is related to the character that these projects are named after, but it also refers to the host distribution that i use the package manager on - Arch Linux.

## Packages
This repository also packages a couple of projects not present in nixpkgs, not that i don't want to contribute to nixpkgs, but they're mainly for personal use.
